# smartcontracts
Some smart contract testing.

These smart contracts are basically not production. They would need some modifiers to make them production ready.
Also highly I HIGHLY recommend audits before you deploy anything into production. 

Of course these are the solidity files only so you would need to integrate the .sol files with your own web facing framework of your choice.
